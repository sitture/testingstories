# What is my role?

My story covers the challenges I faced (and still face) being in a management role. I moved into a management role after working in development teams. I had no previous management experience. I had to change how I worked to face these new challenges.

In general, as a manager you spend less time "doing the things" and more time helping others "do the things". I've had the role of "Test Manager" for a few years now. I deliberately avoided saying that "I am a Test Manager". Simply because I don't believe that fits me.

To elaborate let me look at what being a [test manager is about](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/test-manager). There are dozens of descriptions I could have chosen. But I chose this because in general I like the framework.

Let’s look at this quote from the framework:
> A test manager takes ownership for delivery, creates the strategy and leads its implementation.

That sounds fair enough to me. It fits my mental model of what a Test Manager generally does. But how do I do that?

Like many people who move into management I found the change unsettling. At the time I was unsure if it was better off. One on hand I now had the chance to help more people and teams. But my responsibilities had changed, and I needed to find new ways of doing things. I was out of my comfort zone.

## What do I actually do?

I have a varied job. It includes; test management, test engineering, recruitment, and line management. To mention a few things.

Many aspects of what I do aren't covered by the "Test Manager" umbrella. At least in definitions I could find. I struggled to juggle these different aspects of my job. While I moved into the dizzying heights of test management.

For example, my work with test automation could better sit with a "Test Engineer". I felt my "role" and "job" conflicted at times. I had a job title that told me I should do some things. Yet I had all this other stuff that wasn't mentioned.

## What did I do?

I'd like to say I immediately excelled at the new role and did all the right things in the best way. But that's just not true. I often found myself pulled back towards my comfort zone. This meant I was not always working on the most important thing. Or doing enough of what I needed to do in this management role. I'd realise what was happening and correct myself. Sometimes doing it quickly. Other times putting myself under stress and pressure to complete priority tasks, that I hadn't focussed on enough. A vicious cycle that wasn't the best approach for long term success.

At this point I realised I wasn't consistently engaging with work at the right level. After a lot of thought the reason was obvious. I lacked confidence in my own abilities and experience. I needed ways to do my job more effectively. I needed some fresh ideas.

### Looking inward

Reflecting on who we really are as people is hard. We all have parts of us that we don't like. These are often overlooked for self-preservation. I decided to look a bit closer at who I am, and why I think the way I do. Otherwise how could I break this cycle without some more understanding.

I talked to my manager and some trusted colleagues about where to start. I looked at things like [Myers-Briggs](https://www.myersbriggs.org/) and [StrengthsFinders](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx). I personally found these frameworks useful. They helped me understand more about "why I do things". But also, how I might do things better.

Doing the quizzes or reading the books didn't "solve" my problems. It did give me some ideas and tools to get a bit better. There are plenty of alternatives you could try.

### Looking outward 

In my experience, looking for new ideas is much easier than looking at yourself. I was looking for practical ideas that I could apply. Not more hard questions about me, and "why I tick".

There is no shortage of great people out there sharing their ideas and experience. I consumed as much as I could to try to figure out what to do next. This included information on: testing, management, coaching, learning, and communication. If there was books or podcasts, I was trying them.

I don't have an exhaustive list of everything, but I do have some that I found helpful. The wonderful [Agile Testing books](https://agiletester.ca/), [Modern Testing principles](https://moderntesting.org/), and the [Eisenhower matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/). From these I was able to; try new approaches, aim to add value, and better prioritise my work.

## What's my point?

Beyond the therapy of writing this down? Well change is inevitable and can be scary. But with it comes opportunity. Adapting to change is part of life. We work in technology where change is fast and disruptive. To survive we need to handle change. To thrive we need to embrace it. Grow from it. As hard as that can be.

Looping back to the title of this story:
> What is my role?

In truth I'm not 100% sure. I have a job title which says I should do some stuff. I've figured out some ways to achieve that. That learning journey has given me much more than what I need to "just be a test manager". I've realised I'm probably a bad test manager (from the narrow view of the definition). But I'm someone doing a good job. The job includes test management. But also includes a lot more.

A job title shouldn't prevent you from doing a good job. Whatever that actually looks like. I learned that I want to add value and have real impact. How to do that isn't in a job description. It's up to us to think and work that out for ourselves. It's a bit cliché but "make the job your own".
