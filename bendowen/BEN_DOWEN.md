# Tester of The Day

## Origin story

The story starts, as with all good things, with a joke. Dan Ashby had started a rant on Twitter about Paid-for awards, around the end of July 2020. You can checkout [the thread](https://twitter.com/DanAshby04/status/1288763581333413888) for yourself.

Lot's of people joined in and inspired by the humour, I thought, "what if"? What if I made a daily award? What if it was a free award?

Initially I thought I would choose all the winners myself. Simply look on Twitter, find someone saying something cool about Software Testing and then boom, award them Tester of The Day.

A few days in I was thinking maybe this will last a week, a few people will smile my journey will end. Then something amazing happened, the awesome power of the Software Testing Community awoke. People started to nominating others to be the Tester of the Day.

The community were liking and following the Winners, congratulating them, celebrating them. Some of the early supporters like Chris Armstrong, Arleen Andrews and Marie Drake went on to nominate multiple winners.

Momentum started to build, and I felt an obligation, and some considerable excitement, to keep going. So I built a site, while on a Summer Holiday at my Mum's Seaside Chalet, a precious thing in 2020.

## Celebrating the Community

At the time of writing, "Tester of The Day" has been awarded more then 150 times, since it was it started on the 17th of August 2020. With a handful of people winning more then once.

Antonella Scaravilli also known as @RookieSketches on Twitter shared her personal story of being a multi-time winner of #TesterOfTheDay.

> The first time I was nominated I didn't know what it was and I didn't feel like I deserved it at all. However, the second time was quite a surprise and the fact that I had worked so hard on my notes and that someone gave me a recognition for my sketchnoting meant the world to me...and perhaps that's the lesson I learned, that sometimes the contribution to the industry isn't tangible like a book or a course, but that our presence is important because we're all different and we all bring something to the table.

## Supported by volunteers

I couldn't possibly of come this far continuing to find daily winners without a huge amount of help from the Testing Community.

Of those amazing people who have supported me, a small group of volunteers have gone above and beyond in their regular and continued support.

The volunteers have helped collect nominations, choose winners and develop the website. They have provided invaluable moral support to keep up the rapid daily cadence.
